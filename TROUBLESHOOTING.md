# Troubleshooting

## Q: I get the error "Error: module "server": missing required argument "product_version""

You recently upgraded `terraform` to v0.11 and your `main.tf` file still has pre-v0.11 syntax. You have to replace occurrences of `version` to `product_version`, eg:

```hcl
module "server" {
  source = "./modules/libvirt/suse_manager"
  base_configuration = "${module.base.configuration}"

  name = "server"
  product_version = "3.2-nightly"
}
```

## Q: I get intermittent "Can't retrieve volume /var/lib/libvirt/images/..." errors, Terraform generates plans that do not make sense, planning multiple times yields different results

Please try disabling parallelization of Terraform via the `-parallelism` option:

```
terraform apply -parallelism=1
```

If the problem does not manifest any more, then you are running a version of libvirt that does not yet contain a fix for `virHashSearch` - your libvirt logs should also contain lines like the following:

```
virHashSearch:727 : Hash operation not allowed during iteration
```

This is a known libvirt bug which is only solved from version 4.3.0 on. Presently openSUSE Leap, SLES and Ubuntu LTS distros are all affected, bug reports have been posted and patches are in the process to be included in respective packages.

Reported against SUSE distros as: https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1106420
Reported against Ubuntu as: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libvirt/+bug/1789659

## Q: how can I work around a "resource already exists" error?

Typical error message follows:

```
Error applying plan:

1 error(s) occurred:

* libvirt_domain.domain: Error defining libvirt domain: [Code-9] [Domain-20] operation failed: domain 'suma3pg' already exists with uuid b7ea7c0c-a2d5-4671-a2b5-ce17923ad326
```

In this case, Terraform thinks a resource does not exist and must be created (in other words, the resource is not yet in the [Terraform state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/)), while in reality it's there already.

This typically happens in case of errors, or if a previous `terraform apply` failed. In those cases, there is no bug and you have to fix the situation yourself â€” Terraform is right about complaining the world is not in the state it expects.

The most straightforward way to solve this is to delete the corresponding resource manually (eg. using `virsh undefine suma3pg` or graphically in `virt-manager` in libvirt) and then `terraform apply` the configuration again.

The other possibility would be to fix `terraform.tfstate` manually, which is sometimes possible by copypasting carefully JSON sections from backups - but in general this is error prone and discouraged.

## Q: how can I work around a "resource not found" error?

Typical error message follows:

```
Error refreshing state: 1 error(s) occurred:

* libvirt_volume.main_disk: Can't retrieve volume /var/lib/libvirt/images/suma3pg-main-disk
```

This means you have removed manually a Terraform-managed resource, so Terraform believes a resource existed (it's in the [Terraform state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/)) but it does not. This is in general a bug, so an issue should be reported ([example](https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt/issues/74)).

Anyway you can work around the problem by removing the resource from the Terraform state, bringing back coherence with Terraform's vision of the world and the world itself:

```
$ terraform state list
...
module.suma3pg.module.suse_manager.libvirt_volume.main_disk
...
$ terraform state rm module.suma3pg.module.suse_manager.libvirt_volume.main_disk
Item removal successful.
```

## Q: how can I work around name resolution problems with `tf.local` mDNS/Zeroconf/Bonjour/Avahi names?

Typical error message follows:

```
Could not resolve hostname suma3pg.tf.local: Name or service not known
```

Check that:
 - your firewall is not blocking UDP port 5353
   - on SUSE systems check YaST -> Security and Users -> Firewall -> Allowed Services, "Zeroconf/Bonjour Multicast DNS" should either appear on the list or be added

   or

   - edit `/etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2` and add `mdns` to `FW_SERVICES_DMZ_UDP`
     (assuming that your bridge interface is in `FW_DEV_DMZ`)
 - avahi is installed and running
   - typically you can check this via systemd: `systemctl status avahi-daemon`
 - mdns is configured in glibc's Name Server Switch configuration file

In `/etc/nsswitch.conf` you should see a `hosts:` line that looks like the following:
```
hosts:          files mdns [NOTFOUND=return] dns
```
`mdns` (optionally suffixed with `4` for IPv4-only or `6` for IPv6-only) should be present in this line. If it is not, add it.

## Q: how can I work around a libvirt permission denied error?

Typical error message follows:
```
* libvirt_domain.domain: Error creating libvirt domain: [Code-1] [Domain-10]
internal error: process exited while connecting to monitor:
2016-10-14T06:49:07.518689Z qemu-system-x86_64: -drive file=/var/lib/libvirt/images/mirror-main-disk,format=qcow2,if=none,id=drive-virtio-disk0:
Could not open '/var/lib/libvirt/images/mirror-main-disk':
Permission denied
```

Another possible one is:
```
* libvirt_domain.domain: Error creating libvirt domain: virError(Code=1, Domain=0, Message='internal error: child reported: Kernel does not provide mount namespace: Permission denied')
```

Yet another one is:
```
Failed to connect socket to '/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock': No such file or directory'
```

Some variants of this issue will also be logged in `/var/log/syslog` like:
```
Oct 14 08:10:03 dell kernel: [52456.461754] audit: type=1400 audit(1476425403.666:27):
apparmor="DENIED" operation="open" profile="libvirt-4d4f9b58-f50d-4f60-a8a1-315c9a2d02c1"
name="/var/lib/libvirt/images/terraform_mirror_main_disk"
pid=4193 comm="qemu-system-x86" requested_mask="wr" denied_mask="wr"
fsuid=106 ouid=106
```

There are two possible causes: plain Unix permissions or AppArmor.

### Plain Unix permissions

Check that the interested directory (in the case above `/var/lib/libvirt/images`) is writable by the user running `qemu` (you can check it via `ps -eo uname:20,comm | grep qemu-system-x86` when you have at least one virtual machine running).

If the directory has wrong permissions:
 - fix their them manually via `chmod`/`chown`;
 - check that the pool definition has right user and permissions via `virsh pool-edit <POOL_NAME>` (note that mode is specified in octal and user/group as IDs, see `id -u <USERNAME>` and `cat /etc/groups`).

If the user running `qemu` is not the one you expected:
 - change the `user` and `group` variables in `/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf`, typically `root`/`root` will solve any problem
 - restart the libvirt daemon

### AppArmor

AppArmor can be used both to isolate the host from its guests, and guests from one another. Both of those protections must be properly configured in order for sumaform to operate correctly. Unfortunately, this configuration can be difficult and is well beyond the scope of this guide. Following are instructions to disable AppArmor completely in non-security-sensitive environments.

 * host-guest protection: add `security_driver = "none"` to `/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
 * guest-guest protection:
```sh
sudo ln -s /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.libvirtd /etc/apparmor.d/disable/
sudo /etc/init.d/apparmor restart
sudo aa-status | grep libvirt # output should be empty
```

## Q: how can I workaround a "dial tcp" error?

If you run into this error:

`* dial tcp 192.168.122.193:22: getsockopt: network is unreachable`

during the `terraform apply`, it means Terraform was able to create a VM, but then is unable to log in via SSH do configure it. This is typically caused by network misconfiguration - `ping 192.168.122.193` should work but it does not. Please double check your networking configuration. If you are using AWS, make sure your current IP is listed in the `ssh_allowed_ips` variable (or check it is whitelisted in AWS Console -> VPC -> Security Groups).

## Q: how do I re-apply the Salt state that was used to provision the machine?

Run `sh /root/salt/highstate.sh`.

## Q: how to force the re-creation of a resource?

A: you can use [Terraform's taint command](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/taint.html) to mark a resource to be re-created during the next `terraform apply`. To get the correct name of the module and resource use `terraform state list`:

```
$ terraform state list
...
module.suma3pg.module.suse_manager.libvirt_volume.main_disk

$ terraform taint -module=suma3pg.suse_manager libvirt_volume.main_disk
The resource libvirt_volume.main_disk in the module root.suma3pg.suse_manager has been marked as tainted!
```
## Q: how to force the re-download of an image?

A: see above, use the taint command as per the following example:

```
$ terraform state list
...
module.base.libvirt_volume.volumes[2]

$ terraform taint -module=base libvirt_volume.volumes.2
The resource libvirt_volume.volumes.2 in the module root.base has been marked as tainted!
```

Please note that any dependent volume and module should be tainted as well before applying (eg. if you are tainting the `sles12sp2` image, make sure you either have no VMs based on that OS or that they are all tainted).

## Q: I get the error "* file: open /home/<user>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub: no such file or directory in:"

Terraform cannot find your SSH key in the default path `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. See [Accessing VMs](modules/libvirt/README.md#accessing-vms) for details.

## Q: how can I workaround an "libvirt_domain.domain: diffs didn't match during apply" libvirt error?

If you have just switched from non-bridged to bridged networking or vice versa you might get the following error:

```
Error applying plan:

1 error(s) occurred:

* libvirt_domain.domain: diffs didn't match during apply. This is a bug with Terraform and should be reported as a GitHub Issue.
...
Mismatch reason: attribute mismatch: network_interface.0.bridge
```

This is a known issue, simply repeat the `terraform apply` command and it will go away.

## Q: how do I workaround a "stat salt: no such file or directory" when applying the plan?

If you run `terraform apply` from outside of the sumaform tree, you will get the error message:

```
Error applying plan:

1 error(s) occurred:

* stat salt: no such file or directory
```

A simple solution is to create a symbolic link pointing to the `salt` directory on top level of the sumaform files tree. Create this symlink in your current directory.

## Q: how can I change to another workspace?

If you want to work with more than one `main.tf` file, for example to use both a libvirt and an OpenStack configuration, you can follow [instructions in the README_ADVANCED.md file](README_ADVANCED.md#working-on-multiple-configuration-sets-workspaces-locally) to set up multiple workspaces.

To change to another workspace just remove and create the corresponding links again, and then execute `terraform init`.

## Q: Why do I get "is not a valid parameter" when I change between workspaces?

When we change between workspaces,it may happen that `terraform init` throws "is not a valid parameter" errors, as if we actually didn't change to another workspace. To resolve this just remove the terraform cache:

```
rm -r .terraform/
```

## Q: How can I work around a "Error accessing remote resource - 403 Forbidden" error?

Typical error message follows:

```
Error: Error applying plan:

1 error(s) occurred:

* module.base.libvirt_volume.centos7_volume: 1 error(s) occurred:

* libvirt_volume.centos7_volume: Error accessing remote resource: https://github.com/moio/sumaform-images/releases/download/4.3.0/centos7.qcow2 - 403 Forbidden
```

You can work around the problem by updating the `terraform-provider-libvirt` package, followed by executing `terraform init`.

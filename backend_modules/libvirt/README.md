# libvirt-specific configuration

## First-time configuration

 - copy `main.tf.libvirt.example` to `main.tf`
 - if your VMs are to be deployed on an external libvirt host:
   - change the libvirt connection URI in the `provider` section. Typically it has the form `qemu+ssh://<USER>@<HOST>/system` assuming that `<USER>` has passwordless SSH access to `<HOST>`
   - set up bridged networking:
     - ensure your target libvirt host has a bridge device on the network you want to expose your machines on ([openSUSE instructions](https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/virtualization/html/book.virt/cha.libvirt.networks.html#libvirt.networks.bridged) [Ubuntu instructions](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkConnectionBridge))
     - uncomment the `bridge` variable declaration in the `base` module and add proper device name (eg. `br1`)
     - change the `network_name` variable declaration to `null`
     - optionally specify fixed MAC addresses by adding `mac = "CA:FE:BA:BE:00:01"` lines to VM modules
   - if other sumaform users deploy to the same host, or different bridged hosts in the same network, uncomment the `name_prefix` variable declaration in the `base` module to specify a unique prefix for your VMs
 - complete the `cc_password` variable in the `base` module
 - make sure that:
   - either your target libvirt host has a storage pool named `default`
   - or you [create one](https://documentation.suse.com/sles/12-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-libvirt-storage.html#sec-libvirt-storage-vmm-addpool)
   - or you specify a different name by uncommenting the `pool` variable declaration in the `base` module
 - if you are not using bridged networking, make sure that:
   - either your target libvirt host has a NAT network which is named `default`
   - or you [create one](https://documentation.suse.com/sles/12-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-libvirt-networks.html#libvirt-networks-virtual-vmm-define)
     - Note: ipv6 is configured by default on all VMs created by sumaform, so make sure to enable ipv6 too (DHCPv6 is not necessary)
   - or you specify a different name by uncommenting the `network_name` variable declaration in the `base` module
 - decide the set of virtual machines you want to run. Delete any `module` section relative to VMs you don't want to use and feel free to copy and paste to add more
 - Create a symbolic link to the `libvirt` backend module directory inside the `modules` directory: `ln -sfn ../backend_modules/libvirt modules/backend`
 - run `terraform init` to make sure Terraform has detected all modules
 - run `terraform apply` to actually have the VMs set up!

## libvirt backend specific variables

Most modules have configuration settings specific to the libvirt backend, those are set via the `provider_settings` map variable. They are all described below.

### Base module

Available provider settings for the base module:

| Variable name      | Type   | Default value | Description                                                              |
|--------------------|--------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| pool               | string | `default`     | libvirt storage pool name for VM disks                                   |
| network_name       | string | `default`     | libvirt NAT network name for VMs, use null for bridged networking        |
| bridge             | string | `null`        | a bridge device name available on the libvirt host, leave null for NAT   |
| additional_network | string | `null`        | A network mask for PXE tests                                             |

An example follows:
```hcl-terraform
...
provider_settings = {
  pool               = "ssd"
  network_name       = "my_network"
  bridge             = "br1"
  additional_network = "192.168.32.0/24"
}
...
```

### Host modules

Following settings apply to all modules that create one or more hosts of the same kind, such as `suse_manager`, `suse_manager_proxy`, `client`, `grafana`, `minion`, `mirror`, `sshminion`, `pxe_boot` and `virthost`:

| Variable name   | Type           | Default value                                                | Description                                                                                |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| memory          | number         | `1024` ([apart from specific roles](Default-values-by-role)) | RAM memory in MiB                                                                          |
| vcpu            | number         | `1` ([apart from specific roles](Default-values-by-role))    | Number of virtual CPUs                                                                     |
| running         | bool           | `true`                                                       | Whether this host should be turned on or off                                               |
| mac             | string         | `null`                                                       | A MAC address in the form AA:BB:CC:11:22:22                                                |
| additional_disk | `list[string]` | [ ]                                                          | List of volume IDs of disks to be attached to this host                                    |
| cpu_model       | string         | `custom`                                                     | Defines what CPU model the guest is getting (host-model, host-passthrough or the default). |
| xslt            | string         | `null` ([apart from specific roles](Default-values-by-role)) | XSLT contents to apply on the libvirt domain                                               |

An example follows:
```hcl-terraform
...
provider_settings = {
  memory          = 2048
  vcpu            = 2
  running         = true
  mac             = "52:54:00:1d:af:5a"
  additional_disk = ["volume_id"]
  cpu_model       = "custom"
  xslt            = "file.xslt"
}
...
```

#### Default provider settings by role

Some roles such as `suse_manager` or `mirror` have specific defaults that override those in the table above. Those are:

| Role         | Default values                                                                               |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| suse_manager | `{memory=4096, vcpu=2}`                                                                      |
| mirror       | `{memory=512}`                                                                               |
| controller   | `{memory=2048}`                                                                              |
| grafana      | `{memory=4096}`                                                                              |
| virthost     | `{memory=2048, vcpu=3, cpu_model = "host-model", xslt = file("${path.module}/sysinfos.xsl"}` |

### Volume

`suse_manager`, `proxy` and `mirror` modules have configuration settings specific for extra data volumes, those are set via the `volume_provider_settings` map variable. They are described below.

 * `pool = <String>` storage were the volume should be created (default value `default`)

 An example follows:
 ``` hcl-terraform
volume_provider_settings = {
  pool = "ssd"
}
```

## Accessing VMs

All machines come with user `root` with password `linux`. They are also accessible via your SSH public key (by default `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) if you have one.

By default, the machines use Avahi (mDNS), and are configured on the `.tf.local` domain. Thus if your host is on the same network segment of the virtual machines you can simply use:

```
ssh root@suma32pg.tf.local
```

If you use Avahi and are on another network segment, you can only connect using an IP address, because mDNS packets do not cross network boundaries unless using reflectors.

If you want to use a different SSH key, please check the README_ADVANCED.md file, in section "Custom SSH keys".
If you don't want to use mDNS, or want to forward Avahi between networks, please check that same file, in section "Disabling Avahi and Avahi reflectors".
If mDNS does not work out of the box, please check TROUBLESHOOTING.md file, under question "How can I work around name resolution problems with `tf.local` mDNS/Zeroconf/Bonjour/Avahi names?".

Web access is on standard ports, so `firefox server.tf.local` will work as expected. SUSE Manager default user is `admin` with password `admin`.

Finally, the images come with serial console support, so you can use

```
virsh console suma32pg
```
especially in the case the network is not working and you need to debug it, or if the images have difficulties booting.

## Only upload a subset of available images

By default all known base OS images are uploaded to the libvirt host (currently several versions of SLES and CentOS). It is possible to limit the OS selection in order to avoid wasting space and bandwidth, if the needed OSs are known a priori.

In order to do that use the `images` variable in the `base` module, like in the following example:

```hcl
module "base" {
  source = "./modules/base"

  ...
  images = ["centos7", "sles12sp2"]
}
```

The list of all supported images is available in "backend_modules/libvirt/base/variables.tf".
